Personalized Consumption Patterns and Behavior Learning
Feature: Implement machine learning models that not only predict future usage but also learn the unique behavior patterns of the household. For example, it can account for habits like when a family member typically uses the microwave, or when specific appliances are used for certain tasks (e.g., washing machine during the day).

Impact: Personalization adds a layer of precision to your systemâ€™s recommendations. Over time, the system will become more accurate at predicting when appliances are used and offer tailored suggestions for energy savings.
